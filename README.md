# Fitness Witness

## Overview

(___TODO__: a brief one or two paragraph, high-level description of your project_)

Keeping up with a regular habit of exercise is hard enough. Trying to remember new workouts and keeping track of old ones also wastes time and effort, when you could be using those precious minutes to maximize dem GAINZ. ðŸ’ª

Fitness Witness is a web app that will allow users to keep track of their workout routines. Users can register and login. Once they're logged in, they can create and view their workout routines. As the users work out, they can select a routine and check off exercises as they go.

(Optional features:)
- Users can also add other users as friends and view their public workouts
- Users can also track their progress regarding body weight and strength (workout template, add variable weight/sets/reps during the workout)

## Data Model

(___TODO__: a description of your application's data and their relationships to each other_) 

The application will store Users, Workouts, and Exercises (maybe make Sets schema to customize reps/weight for each set)(Optional: Friends)

* users can have multiple workouts (via references)
* each workout can have multiple exercises (by embedding)

(___TODO__: sample documents_)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "reps4jesus",
  hash: // a password hash,
  workouts: // an array of references to Workout documents
}
```

An Example Workout with Embedded Exercises:

```javascript
{
  user: "Kshoes", // a reference to a User object
  name: "Leg Day",
  exercises: [
    { name: "squats", sets: 5, reps: 6, weight: 225, checked: true},  // weight in lbs
    { name: "deadlifts", sets: 5, reps: 6, weight: 225, checked: false},
    { name: "hip thrusts", sets: 5, reps: 8, weight: 135, checked: false}
  ],
  createdAt: // timestamp
}
```
